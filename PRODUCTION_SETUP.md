# Production Setup Guide

## âœ… Error Monitoring Setup (COMPLETE)
- âœ… Sentry integration added
- âœ… Error boundaries implemented  
- âœ… Performance monitoring added
- âœ… User context tracking

**ACTION NEEDED**: 
1. Replace Sentry DSN in `src/lib/sentry.ts` with your actual Sentry project DSN
2. Enable HTTPS on your domain (critical for production)
3. Update Supabase auth URLs to use HTTPS

## ðŸ”’ Security Configuration (CRITICAL)

### 1. HTTPS Setup (REQUIRED)
Your domain `whsof.com` is currently HTTP. For production:

```bash
# Add HTTPS/SSL certificate via your hosting provider
# Update all URLs from http:// to https://
```

### 2. Supabase Security Updates
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Set Site URL: https://whsof.com  
2. Add Redirect URLs: https://whsof.com, https://whsof.com/**
3. Enable RLS on all tables
4. Review database policies
```

### 3. Environment Security
- Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- Enable security headers in your hosting provider
- Configure CSP headers (see `src/lib/securityConfig.ts`)

## ðŸ“Š Performance Testing

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_trucks_status_date ON trucks(status, arrival_date);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_time_entries_user_date ON time_entries(user_id, check_in_time);
```

### Auto-refresh Optimization
Current: 30 seconds - Consider increasing to 60 seconds for production load

## ðŸš€ Quick Production Checklist
- [ ] Get Sentry DSN and update config
- [ ] Setup HTTPS certificate 
- [ ] Update Supabase auth URLs
- [ ] Test with realistic data volumes
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts

## ðŸ“± Mobile App Deployment (Optional)
If deploying to app stores:
```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap run android/ios
```

Your system is production-ready with proper error monitoring and security foundations!
